# pyaceqd
Calculate the population dynamics in a QD using ACE, optionally including the interaction with environments (phonons, photons)

See [ACE](https://github.com/mcygorek/ACE) and its [documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mcygorek/ACE/blob/master/documentation/documentation.html)

Also features the calculation of several multi-time correlation functions.

This assumes that the ACE binary is somewhere in the $PATH.
